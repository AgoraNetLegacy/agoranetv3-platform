# AgoraNet v3 — Build Law

This repository builds AgoraNet v3. **The specification corpus is law;
this file tells every session where the law lives and how to build
under it.**

## The Corpus (read before building anything)

- **Spec corpus:** `/Users/shawn/Desktop/Agoranetv3/` — 22+ ratified
  documents. Start with `AGORANET_V3_MODULE_INVENTORY.md` (the master
  index) and `BUILD_ORDER.md` (the construction sequence, phases 0–9
  plus 6.5/7.5).
- **Deferred items registry:** `OPEN_ITEMS_CHECKLIST.md` (Desktop
  corpus) — Tracks 5/6 are build-time and post-launch items with named
  homes. Consult before inventing.
- **v2 reuse source:** `/Users/shawn/Documents/Claude/Projects/Agoranet/platform`
  — three declared reuses: the Light Score engine,
  `lib/canon.ts` (7 pillars + 49 questions as data), and the
  `db:verify` hash-chain ledger check pattern. Port deliberately;
  never import blindly.

## The Methodology (owner-ratified; non-negotiable)

1. **Build exactly what the specs say. Where they're silent, FLAG —
   never invent.** (Owner: "you just build like the specs say.")
2. **One slice, one review** (BUILD_ORDER Rule 1): every phase ends
   with the owner seeing its checkpoint work. No phase begins before
   the previous phase's review.
3. **No feature ever bypasses the gate interface** — even in Phase A
   when bypassing would be easy.
4. **SQLite alone until deployment is imminent** (DATABASE_SETUP.md);
   Postgres + parity checking arrive at Phase 8.
5. **Internal balances before chains.** The economy is database rows
   until Phase 9's legal gate.
6. **Honest disclosures ship with their features** (Phase A
   operator-trust language, permanence badges, correlation warnings).
7. **When a phase checkpoint passes owner review, update the phase
   pointers before starting the next phase:** the "Current Phase"
   section at the bottom of this file AND the CURRENT PHASE block in
   `/Users/shawn/Desktop/Agoranetv3/BUILD_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md` (+ regen
   its PDF). Every new session must land on the true current phase —
   a stale pointer is a build hazard.

## Vocabulary & Conventions

- Users are **souls**; friends are **fellow souls**; Alias succession
  is **hatching**. Product prose uses this vocabulary; legal terms of
  art may retain standard wording.
- All fee/reward amounts come from
  `Economics/ECONOMIC_STARTING_DEFAULTS.md` (testing defaults, in
  units where reply = 1u) — implement as configurable rails, never
  hardcoded constants.
- ⚠ v2's "chambers" (pillar containers) ≠ v3 **Chambers** (Pollinator
  pods). Never merge them.
- Every parameter is a rail: poll-adjustable within bounds. Build
  parameters as data, not literals.

## Current Phase

**Phase 4 — The Internal Economy** (see BUILD_ORDER.md and
`tokenomics/TOKENOMICS_SPEC.md` + `Economics/
ECONOMIC_STARTING_DEFAULTS.md`; Phases 0–3 passed owner review
2026-07-10): per-profile internal balances (PollCoin AND Gratium),
the treasury account, every ratified fee wired — creation fees,
reply/vote micro-fees, governance micro-fee, paid permanence — plus
the Welcome Grant (deferred from Phase 2); tipping (unique-tipper
ranking activates in the sort menu); attestation rails (human-made
marks, vouched/unverified sharing, track-record counts); source tags
+ shared source objects (AI summaries may trail as their own
mini-review). Legal gate check: internal-only currencies need
review-lite; confirm the non-withdrawable Gratium posture with
counsel before launch marketing mentions tokens.

**Phase 4 checkpoint (owner review):** the owner tips, pays for
permanence, and watches the treasury fill on a raw inspection page
(dashboard comes later).
